MediInventory models a small clinic or pharmacy inventory:

What medicines you have (name, form, strength…)

Where they are stored (cabinet, fridge, room)

How much stock you have (batches, expiry date)

Movements: received from supplier, dispensed/used, adjusted (e.g., damaged)

Dashboards:

current stock

low-stock items

soon-to-expire batches

monthly usage trend
